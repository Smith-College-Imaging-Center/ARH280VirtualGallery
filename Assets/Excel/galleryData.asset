      of what a horse looks like, with its disproportionately large, round rump, small
      head, and expressive human-like eyes. These visual features, commonly seen in
      ancient Chinese horse paintings, were viewed as favorable traits in a superior
      steed. The horse is showing its teeth and flaring its nostrils. Is it happy,
      frightened, or angry? Is it fighting against its restraint? Whatever emotion
      the artist was trying to convey, he vividly captured the physical strength of
      the horse. Commissioned by Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712-756) of the Tang dynasty,
      this piece probably portrays one of his favorite chargers as a symbol of imperial
      power. '

      for capturing not only the formal likeness of the botanical structure of the
      plum blossom but also its spirit. This painting shows a branch of plum blossoms
      hanging down from what one can assume is the rest of the tree. The motif of
      plum blossom was traditionally associated with simplicity and endurance. These
      Confucian virtues are embodied in the picture with a simple composition of the
      hearty branch and delicate blooms. Notice the meticulous details rendering the
      individual flower petals and the texture of the bough. The spontaneous strokes
      show Wang Mian's freedom to express emotion. The branch hangs in an \u201CS\u201D

      in Chinese folklore. His works frequently themed on the idea of ephemerality,
      which is epitomized in this painting. Tang composed and inscribed a poem on
      the picture: \u201CWearing a white-bordered scholar robe and green jade pendants,
      he is unconcerned with worldly fame. Like Pan Lang resisting old age through
      high spirits, crazy and clumsy, he rides his donkey past Mount Hua.\u201D The
      stiff brushstrokes of the mountain stone and the distinct colors of the vegetation
      grab the eye, softened only by the misty clouds and the shrouded background
      peaks. Yet, despite how boldly Mount Hua looms, this image remains a mere snapshot
      of a sight seen as the poem\u2019s speaker passes by it, \u201Ccrazy and clumsy.\u201D
      Tang Yin uses the balance between his painting and poetry to illustrate his
      theme of impermanence, showing Mount Hua to be a flashy but passing thought
      on a grander journey."

      reality and imagination as an escape from the mundane chores of court service.
      Cheng even commented on the picture: \"The wondrous part of this lies between

      virtues of righteousness and loyalty. His majestic appearance is based on Chinese
      folk imagery, which features a pink face and long beard. Above the seated warrior
      is an eight-line poem quoted from the fourteenth century Romance of the Three
      Kingdoms, which praises Guan\u2019s military accomplishment and nobility, since
      he was deified as the god of war. Guan is portrayed with thin lines, and the
      calligraphy is similarly done in a standardized, emotionless manner. The consistent
      style of brushwork thus amplifies the dispassionate presence of the noble hero.

      allegory of gentlemen. In his poem, Shitao draws upon this allegory to express
      his attachment to virtuous friends in a life of displacement. Living in the
      early Qing Dynasty as a descendant of the Ming imperial family, he experienced
      many dangers and traveled involuntarily from city to city. Shitao immersed himself
      in art as a way to transcend the difficulties in life and achieved great innovation
      in painting. As this album leaf demonstrates, he integrates calligraphy and
      painting by using the same types of brushstrokes. The branches are uniform,
      rhythmic lines, and the petals and buds resemble enlarged dots, whereas the
      poem on the left is as if composed of slender orchid leaves. \n\nPoem in translation:

      his evokes an abstract and enigmatic landscape characteristic of Bada Shanren\u2019s
      bold individual style. The erecting rocks constitute the dual focus of the composition.
      A single line asserts the foreground, whereas the boulder on the upper left
      recedes into an indefinite distance. Two swimming fish transform the void into
      a pond that unifies the composition as a single pictorial space--but paradoxically
      highlights an unsettling sense of absence. Landscape elements are minimally
      incorporated to signify--rather than render--spatial relations. Like a Chinese
      character, it is through arranging seemingly independent units that Bada Shanren
      achieves a coherent visual expression--one that is incredibly rich in meaning."

      the painter and calligrapher commanded ink. The sheep in this painting seems

      of loose dry strokes. The two animals balance each other in texture and form.
      Although voids separate the sheep and the goat in the middle, their poses create
      circular energy, a silent but fluid interaction across the composition. In both
      animals, there is a balance between the expressiveness of ink and Zhao\u2019s
      precision, seen in the energetic textures of the bodies compared to the extreme
      detail in their faces and legs. Working during the early Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368),
      Zhao Mengfu was a scholar-amateur in calligraphy and painting. Zhao\u2019s background

      the artistic pursuit from naturalistic representation to self-expression. Paintings
      of nature became a means for the artist to express his ideas and communicate
      with his educated peers. In this painting, Zhao Mengfu painted the pine trees
      as a way of manifesting his political strength in the Mongol court. This picture
      also demonstrated through the application of a variety of calligraphic brushwork
      and arrangement of the subjects the artistic concept of "painting and calligraphy
      as one," which he fervently promoted. Zhao put the title to the right of the
      pine trees and inscriptions to the left side of the handscroll, a format that
      was often used in works of calligraphy.

    labelText: "The hanging scroll marked the maturity of Shen Zhou as a literati
      artist. It illustrated the view of a stream of water, banked by tall trees and
      mountain. Shen simplified his previous complicated painting techniques, and
      drew the fundamental components of the subjects from the Yuan artist Huang Gongwang.
      He used pale ink to contour the outline of the subjects at first and then went
      over the outlines with darker and denser ink. The result of this was a feeling
      of mistiness you can perceive. \nShenzhou painted the painting at the age of
      fifty, less than two months after his father\u2019s death. The scenery symbolized
      an expression of a rather complicated emotion during this special time of his
      both personal and artistic life. The mixture of dejected loneliness due to the
      loss of his fatherly figure, and warmly solace he could find among his friends.

      subject choice with this painting of the Daoist Immortal Magu. He depicts the
      female Immortal with her usual cloak, leaf apron, and basket of flowers and
      lingzhi along with her bird-claw-esque fingernails; yet, there is a certain
      softness to her gaze, hair, and clothes. Magu stands out from the sharpness
      of the world around her, as does the auspicious deer to her side. The adapted
      Chinese monochrome style ties in with the Immortal\u2019s Chinese origins, but
      Koboku renders both in his own way, favoring variations in tonality, stroke
      type, and shading style. Also notice this work\u2019s intimate size and the
      prominent space that the Immortal takes up on the paper. Magu\u2019s gentle
      expression and wry smile animate her black-and-white form and like the deer,
      the audience is asked to gaze at her from a close perspective."

      Life) is an excellent example of the influence of Wang\u2019s traditional training

      Chinese character shou, meaning \u201Clongevity\u201D or \u201Clong life.\u201D
      Wang employs a brush heavily saturated with rich, obsidian ink, to the point
      of oversaturation; in some places you can see where the ink has bled, notably
      towards the bottom of the character. The calligraphy perfectly embodies the
      meaning of shou, with its carefree yet intentional style that appears to have
      been done in one continuous stroke, symbolic of a long, prosperous life led
      with intentionality of a master calligrapher and the spontaneity of the semi-cursive
      script. The characters on the left side of the hanging scroll indicate that
      Wang dedicated this piece to Xue Fu on his 90th birthday in 1976. "

      and social harmony create ease.\u201D\n\tThe polka-dotted red background represents
      spotted bamboo, an iconic symbol in Chinese mythology. The myth dictates that
      after the death of the legendary Emperor Shun, the tears of his wives speckled
      the bamboo trees outside the palace, thus creating spotted bamboo. There does
      not appear to be any link between the myth and the contents of Su Shi\u2019s
      poem. However, from a purely aesthetic stance, the calligraphy and the spotted

      objective, which we can see in the careful brushwork throughout the piece. This
      piece is particularly interesting with its bold use of color to highlight the
      bamboo leaves, as well as the fine detail of the finches. If you look closely,
      you can see that the eyes of the finches are painted using a lacquer, making
      them appear to be more lifelike. Despite Emperor Huizong\u2019s dedication to

      magpie feel less flat. If you think about the contrast between the magpie and
      the space around it, your eye is drawn to the bird. It is also interesting to
      look at how the brushstrokes used to create the magpie differ from the strokes
      used to create the willow: while the magpie is made up for broad, smooth strokes,
      the willow is made of short, jagged strokes as well as some speckling. This

      the rapids of the Yangtze River is only one of many. Across Asia, artists sought
      to portray Bodhidharma's spiritual presence. According to popular myth, after
      a disagreement with the Chinese emperor Liang Wudi (464\u2013549), the Indian
      monk Bodhidharma set off towards northern China. To meet these ends, Bodhidharma
      crossed the Yangtze River by standing still on a single reed. Here, Sess\u014D
      T\u014Dy\u014D relies upon line-work, done in a calligraphic style that was
      very popular in Buddhist circles. Using long, curvilinear strokes to describe
      the monk\u2019s form against a blank background, Sess\u014D creates a calm and
      quiet atmosphere. You may also notice his large, expressive eyes, partly obscured
      by his distinctive brows, and his clawed feet. These serve to identify him as
      a foreigner. Additionally, his stern expression and perfect balance on the reed
      communicate both his determination and enlightenment. Much like a spirit, Bodhidharma
      effortlessly overcomes the river\u2019s barrier.\n\n(Katie Rebhun, Katie Simpson,
